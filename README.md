# Glode
Will be used for teaching html, css and javascript. 

The repo will be used by teachers as a tool and will be accessible for students.
With time the goal is that every lesson throughout the 12 week program will be available as different branches here.
This will happen gradually as we go through the program 

The repo name represents current week and topic.
example: week-1/html-introduction.
You can switch between them in an easy fashion by changing the branch.
