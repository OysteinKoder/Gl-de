Task: 

Make a todo list with javaScript html and css. 

Requirements:
- It has to be able to add a new task
- It has to have a completed task
- It has to be styled with css in a responsive way
- It has to store the tasks in local storage

Delivery:
- Github repo link 
- Netlify/vercel link

(Bonus tasks are not required, but if you want to learn more, try them out)

Bonus: Medium
- Add a checkbox to mark the task as done
- When the checkbox is marked the task should be styled in a way 
that it is clear that it is done.

Bonus: Hard
Add functionality so that you can log in on different devices and see the same tasks.
This needs two things: authentication/login, and a database to store the tasks.
I recommend using appwrite for this.

- Add a login and auth system to the app,
- Add a database where you can store the tasks.
- You could use appwrite for this.

ps: I think you can use cdn (content delivery network) for appwrite, 
which is a way to use a library with a link inside a script instead of downloading it.
